# ---------------------
# These commands allow to run shell commands directly from within Tig.
# Unless otherwise specified, commands are run in the foreground with
# their console output shown (as if '!' was specified). When multiple
# command options are specified their behavior are combined, e.g. "?<git
# commit" will prompt the user whether to execute the command and will
# exit Tig after completion.
